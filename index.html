        Hans Wilsdorf was born in
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kulmbach">Kulmbach</a>, Bavaria,
        to Protestant parents, Anna and Johan Daniel Ferdinand Wilsdorf and was
        the second son of a family of three children. His mother died when he
        was a boy and he became an orphan when his father died soon after when
        Hans was twelve years old. Wilsdorf's fate was placed in the hands of
        his uncles who sold the prosperous family iron tools business which had
        belonged to his grandfather, and later to his father.

        Hans and his brother and sister were sent to excellent boarding schools
        where they received excellent educations. Wilsdorf published his
        autobiography in 1946 as part of a four-volume set of books named Rolex
        Jubilee Vade Mecum. In his autobiography Hans said "Our uncles were not
        indifferent to our fate; nevertheless, the way in which they made me
        become self-reliant very early in life made me acquire the habit of
        looking after my possessions and, looking back, I believe that it is to
        this that much of my success is due". Wilsdorf excelled in mathematics
        and languages, which inspired him to travel and work in foreign
        countries. Hans began his career as an apprentice with an influential
        international pearl-exporting company. The experience Hans gained played
        a crucial role in of his future dealings.

        >
        to work as an English correspondent and clerk with the watch firm of
        Messrs. Cuno Korten, at 49, rue Leoppold Robert, where he was paid a
        salary of 80 Swiss Francs. At the time, Cuno Korten exported around one
        million francs worth of pocket watches annually. Cuno Korten worked with
        all grades of watches, and manufactured a small number of watches from
        the ground up. Wilsdorf was responsible for winding hundreds of pocket
        watches daily in his role with Cuno Korten, as well as verifying that
        all watches were accurate. Wilsdorf gained tremendous insight into
        watchmaking during his time with Cuno Korten, where he gained valuable
        knowledge about how all types of watches.
